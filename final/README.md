So I have the project set up just like in class, and I called the database usersdb, so you just have to change all of the instances of that to your database name it should work. There is also a connection inside the app.js file where it says 'const dbURI' with the database string, you will have to change that as well.

I was running into cors errors so I installed cors.

I also have mongoose installed in the backend because I wanted to learn it. I also used plain express, so don't worry.

If you don't have it and need it is just 'npm i mongoose'

Note: you have to hit the login button inside of the login popup one extra time at the beginning then you can test all you want.
