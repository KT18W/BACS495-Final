So I have the project set up just like in class, and I called the database usersdb, so you just have to change all of the instances of that to your database name it should work.

I also have mongoose installed in the backend because in a lot of the code I looked at, it looked like it made things easier, so I decided to give it a shot.

If you don't have it and need it it is just 'npm i mongoose'
